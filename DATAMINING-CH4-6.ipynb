    "# CHAPTER 4 -- Basics of Using a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "-----\n",
    "*After some toying around, I believe to have them setup within PyCharm and linked to my Github*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Allows for integration of text and images with the code for explanations\n",
    "- Easily shared (as shown with my Github)\n",
    "- Markdown and LaTeX (which I already have experience with in Obsidian.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks:**\n",
    "- Hard to modularize and test\n",
    "- Poor version control\n",
    "- Execution order issues\n",
    "--> Applicable scripts should use .py files to ensure functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Execution and State:\n",
    "- Code is executed in the order the cells are ran--not top-to-bottom.\n",
    "--> This allows for definitions to hold true across the entire notebook\n",
    "--> This is known as KERNEL\n",
    "\n",
    "### METHODS\n",
    "- %run your_script.py\n",
    "- %load your_script.py\n",
    "- import your_script.py\n"

    " 1. Dictionary for ordered sequences\n",
